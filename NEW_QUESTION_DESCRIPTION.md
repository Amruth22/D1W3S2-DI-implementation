# Dependency Injection Implementation - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive dependency injection system for a FastAPI-based library management application that demonstrates proper service architecture, modular design, and testable code patterns. This project focuses on implementing clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, service abstraction, and dependency management for maintainable and scalable applications.

## Project Objectives

1. **Dependency Injection Mastery:** Learn to implement proper dependency injection patterns that promote loose coupling, testability, and maintainable code architecture.

2. **Service Layer Architecture:** Design and implement service layer abstractions that separate business logic from API endpoints and data access layers.

3. **Modular Application Design:** Create modular application structures with clear separation between routers, services, models, and dependencies for improved maintainability.

4. **Async Service Integration:** Implement asynchronous service patterns with proper lifecycle management, connection pooling, and resource cleanup.

5. **Testing Strategy Implementation:** Build testable architectures that support unit testing, integration testing, and mocking of dependencies.

6. **Configuration and Lifecycle Management:** Master application lifecycle management including service initialization, dependency resolution, and graceful shutdown procedures.

## Key Features to Implement

- FastAPI application with proper dependency injection setup using FastAPI's dependency system
- Service layer architecture with database service, cache service, and email service abstractions
- Modular router structure with clean separation of concerns and proper dependency injection
- Async database operations with connection pooling and transaction management
- Comprehensive service lifecycle management with startup and shutdown procedures
- Sample library management system demonstrating real-world dependency injection patterns

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Architecture Design:** Understanding how to structure applications with proper separation of concerns and dependency management
- **Service Abstraction:** Learning to create service interfaces that abstract implementation details and promote testability
- **Dependency Resolution:** Mastering dependency injection patterns including constructor injection, method injection, and service locator patterns
- **Lifecycle Management:** Understanding application lifecycle, service initialization order, and proper resource cleanup
- **Testing Strategies:** Building testable code with proper mocking, stubbing, and dependency substitution techniques
- **Async Patterns:** Implementing asynchronous service patterns with proper error handling and resource management
- **Configuration Management:** Designing flexible configuration systems that support different environments and deployment scenarios

## Expected Outcome

You will create a well-architected FastAPI application that demonstrates professional dependency injection patterns and service-oriented architecture. The system will serve as a foundation for understanding enterprise-level application design and maintainable code practices.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement advanced dependency injection features including scoped dependencies and factory patterns
- Add support for configuration-based dependency resolution and environment-specific service implementations
- Create comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Implement monitoring and logging integration through dependency injection for observability
- Add support for plugin architectures and extensible service registration
- Create documentation and examples for different dependency injection patterns and use cases
- Consider implementing dependency injection containers and advanced service resolution strategies
